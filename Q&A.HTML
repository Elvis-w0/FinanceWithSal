            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>In programming, a variable is a symbolic name or identifier that represents a value stored in
                    computer memory. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. Think of variables as
                    containers that hold different types of information, such as numbers, text, or more complex data
                    structures.

                <p class="fw-bold">Define Data Types in Programming?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>In programming, data types are a classification or categorization of data that specifies which type
                    of value a variable can hold. Data types are essential because they determine how data is stored in
                    memory, how it can be manipulated, and what operations can be performed on it. Different programming
                    languages have their own sets of data types, but there are common data types found in many
                    languages.

            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>In programming, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks.
                    Functions are a fundamental building block of most programming languages, and they play a crucial
                    role in organizing and structuring code. Functions allow you to break down complex problems into
                    smaller, more manageable pieces, making your code more modular and easier to understand, test, and
                    maintain.</p>

                <p class="fw-bold">Explain the Following:
                    a) Compiler
                    b) Translator
                    c) Scripting Language
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <h2>Compiler</h2>
                <p>
                    A compiler is a software tool that translates the entire source code of a program written in a
                    high-level programming language into machine code or a lower-level language all at once. It performs
                    lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and generates an executable binary file. Compilation is done
                    before running the program, and the resulting code is typically faster but less portable.
                </p>
                <h2>Translator</h2>
                <p>
                    A translator is a general term that encompasses various tools for converting code from one language
                    to another. This can include compilers, assemblers (for translating assembly language), and
                    interpreters. Translators convert high-level code into machine code or lower-level code. The
                    specific type of translator used depends on the source and target languages.
                </p>
                <h2>Scripting Language</h2>
                <p>
                    A scripting language is a high-level programming language that is often used for automating tasks,
                    writing scripts, or adding functionality to web pages. Unlike compiled languages, scripts are
                    executed line by line by an interpreter, and they are not compiled into machine code. Popular
                    scripting languages include JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.

                <p class="fw-bold">Explain the Difference between Programming and Coding?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="fw-bold">Coding:</p>
                <p>Coding refers to the process of writing actual lines of code using a specific programming language.
                    It involves translating a set of instructions or an algorithm into a format that a computer can
                    understand and execute. Coding is often considered the more mechanical or technical aspect of
                    software development. It involves tasks like typing out syntax, debugging errors, and ensuring that
                    the code follows the rules of the chosen programming language.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">Programming:</p>
                <p>Programming is a broader and more encompassing term. It includes not only coding but also the entire
                    process of creating software, from conceptualizing and designing a solution to implementing it.
                    Programming involves higher-level activities such as problem-solving, algorithm design, system
                    architecture, and planning how different components of a software system will work together.
                    Programming also includes writing code (coding) but goes beyond that to encompass tasks like
                    understanding user requirements, designing software structures, testing and debugging, and
                    maintaining and updating software over time.</p>
                <h6>In summary, while "coding" focuses on the specific act of writing code, "programming" encompasses a
                    wider range of activities, including problem-solving, design, and the entire process of creating and
                    maintaining software systems.</h6>

                <p class="fw-bold">What is OOP Programming?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm or methodology that uses objects as the
                    fundamental building blocks for designing and implementing software systems. OOP is based on the
                    concept of "objects," which represent real-world entities or concepts and encapsulate both data
                    (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. The primary goal of OOP is to model the real
                    world more accurately and to create software that is modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="fw-bold">Low-Level Language:</p>
                <p>Low-level languages are programming languages that are closer to the machine code and hardware of a
                    computer. They have a strong correspondence with the architecture of the computer's CPU (Central
                    Processing Unit).</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">High-Level Language:</p>
                <p>A high-level programming language is a programming language that is designed to be user-friendly and
                    abstracted from the low-level details of computer hardware. High-level languages provide a higher
                    level of abstraction, allowing programmers to write code that is more human-readable and easier to
                    understand compared to low-level languages.</p>
